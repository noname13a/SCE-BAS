This repository contains the proposal for combining Security Chaos Engineering into a Breach and Attack Simulation platform, found on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03882.

The BAS platform chosen is MITRE Caldera, both branches, 4.2 and 5.3, work, as the API remains the same between them. For use with other platforms, modifications should be done.

For running this proposal, several fields in secrets.py have to be filled for the correct execution of the tool.
